# Light Is Your Friend
## About The Project
As we've discussed, Project 2 will be in a Game Jam format.  
Based on our discussion and your personal research, you're required to develop a GameJam game with the main theme entitled:  
**"Light is your friend"**  
You are free to implement the theme in a 3D or 2D setup, platformer, first person, top down arena, mobile touch based, or any other setting you feel fits the theme.  
Knowing that a GameJam usually lasts 48 hours, I will extend the Jam to a whole week, making it possible to submit your Jam entry on Tuesday 21st.  
You are REQUIRED to ask questions, challenge each other and yourselves and make ideas come to life.  
Game mechanics should be simple and straight forward, Creativity is key.  
You are kindly asked to work in groups, as the Jams are all about communication, problem solving, creativity, team building, and adaptation.  
You are asked to message me your teams (up to 3 students per team). Notify me in case you want to work solo too.   
Rules of the Jam: 
- You can use any assets you can find online. 

- You are to create your Jam game and not use an already complete project. 

- The theme is to be followed and consists of more than 60% of the judging grade. 

- The game should be playable 

- Last day of submission is Tuesday April 21
